    Day 4 : 
            Exercise 1: Simple Addition

                Declare two variables, num1 and num2, with initial values. 
                Add them together and store the result in a new variable called sum.

            Exercise 2: Calculate Area

                Declare a variable radius and assign it a value. 
                Calculate the area of a circle using the 
                    ? formula: area = Ï€ * r^2. 
                Store the result in a variable called circleArea.
                ? HINT: Value of the PI is 3.14

            Exercise 3: Temperature Conversion

                Declare a variable in Celsius and convert it to Fahrenheit using the 
                ? formula: F = (C * 9/5) + 32. 
                Store the result in a variable called fahrenheit.
            
            
            Exercise 4:

                    TODO: SELF LEARNING TOPIC : Arithmetic Modulus Operator % 
                    
                    Self learn Exercise :
                        Declare two variables, dividend and divisor, with initial values. 
                        Use the modulus operator to find the remainder when dividend is divided by divisor. 
                        Store the result in a variable called remainder.
                
                ============================================================================================
            
            Exercise 5: Combining Strings and Numbers

                Declare two variables, firstName (a string) and age (a number). 
                Create a new string that combines both variables to form a sentence 
                like "John is 25 years old."
            
            Exercise 6: Compound Assignment (Short-hand Assignment Operators)

                Declare a variable x with an initial value.
                Perform a series of operations using compound assignment operators 
                to modify the value of x.
                ?HINT: Perform all the Short-Hand Operations to modify the value of X
            
            Exercise 7: Shopping Cart

                Declare a variable representing the total price of items in a shopping cart.
                Apply a discount of 20% and update the total price using a compound assignment operator.
